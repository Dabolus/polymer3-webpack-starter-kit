## Contributing to Polymer 3 Webpack Starter Kit

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this Starter Kit. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### I don't care about this whole thing, I just have a simple question!

If you need an answer, you can either:
  1. Open an issue and assign to it the `question` label, or
  2. If you need a faster response, either join [the Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BgcHHE-NwwWNnnnu2Bnl-Q) or [the Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/p3wsk/shared_invite/enQtMzMxNTUwMTg1NzUwLWFjYWZmOTUwM2IxMzVmMDU2ZjdmMTg2NzgxOWU2MTYwYmM2YjNmYjMwYzUxNzM4ZmI2ODVlMWZmMTI5M2IyNWU) and ask your question there

### How can I contribute?

#### Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug, please make sure it hasn't already been reported by visiting the
[issue section](https://github.com/Dabolus/polymer3-webpack-starter-kit/issues).

If the bug you found hasn't been reported yet, create a new issue and assign it the proper label(s).
Besides this, there isn't any specific guideline on how the bugs should be reported, Just be sure
to be as clear as possible when describing it.

#### Suggesting enhancements

Same as the bug reporting. First of all, check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
If it doesn't exist, create a new issue and give it the `enhancement` label, plus any other proper label.

Keep in mind that what you may find useful might be completely useless for other users,
so please, make sure that the enhancement can actually be useful for everyone before proposing it.
If you find that it is actually useful only for you, consider forking the project and implementing that
enhancement just for yourself.

### Styleguides

#### Commit messages

  - Use the past tense ("Added feature" not "Add feature")
  - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
  - When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title

#### Pull Requests

  - Specify what has been changed/added/removed
  - Write a short and concise title. Be more specific in the description
  - Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
  - Be sure to follow all the project coding guidelines. TSLint will definitely give you a big help with this
  - End all files with a newline
  - Add configuration dependencies as devDependencies, and frontend dependencies as normal dependencies
  - Avoid platform-dependent code

### Code of Conduct

#### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

#### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

  - Using welcoming and inclusive language
  - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
  - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
  - Focusing on what is best for the community
  - Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

  - The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances
  - Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
  - Public or private harassment
  - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission
  - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

#### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

#### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [contact@dabolus.com](mailto:contact@dabolus.com)
or at the [official telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BgcHHE-NwwWNnnnu2Bnl-Q). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

#### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4,
